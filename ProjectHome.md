scim-googlepinyin tries to bring the [open source Google pinyin IME for Android](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/packages/inputmethods/PinyinIME.git) to GNU/Linux. And customize it to fit the need on regular desktop instead of on mobile device by following Google Pinyin on Windows.

This port is almost a line-by line translation from Java to C++. It's still under development. And it needs more testing and bug fixing for sure.
